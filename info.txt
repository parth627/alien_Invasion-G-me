->When choosing artwork for your games, be sure to pay attention to
licensing. The safest and cheapest way to start is to use freely licensed
graphics that you can modify from a website like http://pixabay.com/.

->You can use almost any type of image file in your game, but it’s easiest
if you use a bitmap (.bmp) file because Pygame loads bitmaps by default. 

->(Most images you’ll find are in .jpg, .png, or .gif formats, but you can convert
them to bitmaps using tools like Photoshop, GIMP, and Paint.)

->SHIP.PY:
-Once the image is loaded, we use get_rect() to access the surface’s rect
attribute. One reason Pygame is so efficient is that it lets you treat game
elements like rectangles (rects), even if they’re not exactly shaped like rectangles.

-When you’re centering a game element, work with the center, centerx, or
centery attributes of a rect. When you’re working at an edge of the screen,
work with the top, bottom, left, or right attributes. When you’re adjusting
the horizontal or vertical placement of the rect, you can just use the x and
y attributes, which are the x- and y-coordinates of its top-left corner.

-In Pygame, the origin (0, 0) is at the top-left corner of the screen, and coordinates
increase as you go down and to the right. On a 1200 by 800 screen, the origin is at
the top-left corner, and the bottom-right corner has the coordinates (1200, 800).
